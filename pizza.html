<h3>Classic Pizza: originally Italian and totally customisable.
</h3>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2> 

<h4> This dish can be vegetarian - add no meat. Prepare time: 1h 20mins.</h4>
<h3> Serves 8</h3>
<ol>
<li>800 g strong white bread flour </li>
<li>200 g fine ground semolina flour or strong white bread flour</li>
<li>2 x 7 g sachets of dried yeast</li>
<li>1 level teaspoon fine sea salt </li>
<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
<li>1 bunch of fresh basil</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>1 x 400 g tin of plum tomatoes</li>
<li>85 g mozzarella cheese</li>
</ol>


<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ul>

    Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
    <br>
    Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
    <br>
    Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
    <br>
    Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.

</ul>
