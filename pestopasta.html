  <strong>1. Pesto</strong>- This recipe is intended for use with this homemade pesto which I also shared today. But the same technique applies to store bought. If using store bought, use 1/2 cup+. Usually require less than when using homemade because they have a more concentrated flavour from basil extract.
    <br> <br>
<strong>2. Pasta</strong>- Ziti and penne are my favourites for pesto (explained in post). Spaghetti is next, then other long strand pastas.
<ol>
<li> Use 300g/10oz for a really great coating of pesto sauce - 3 large servings, 4 smallish servings.</li>
<li>Use up to 350g/12oz for "normal" amount of pesto sauce to pasta - 4 standard servings.</Li>
<li>Don't use more pasta for one batch of homemade pesto, the pasta will lack pesto flavour.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<strong>3. General tips for great pesto!</strong> <br>
    <strong>Toss in a bowl, not the pot you cooked the pasta in </strong> – basil doesn’t like heat. It turns black. The heat from the pasta is ok – but if you add the heat from the pot, the basil won’t like it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Take out 1 cup of pasta cooking water just before you drain </strong> (not earlier, otherwise it’s not starchy enough). Take out way more than you think you need, you might need it. You will be surprised how much the pasta can absorb – I used 3/4 cup for 300g/10oz pasta for the spaghetti in the video (because I kept tossing to film and it kept sucking up the sauce!)
    <br><br>
    <strong>Salt the water</strong> – Pesto usually isn’t (and should not be) seasoned enough such that you don’t need to add any other salt once tossed through pasta. The best way to season Pesto Pasta is to salt the water.
